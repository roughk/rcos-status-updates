## Last Week's Accomplishments
The goals of schedj have gotten larger over time, so we discussed focusing our work on getting our minimum viable product finished.
The MVP for this project is a mechanism to register/add or drop classes

## This Week's Plan
Look into running an emulator to allow debugging of code on computer rather than having to test it on another member's phone.

## Anything Blocking?
WSL and VMWare and really messed up my computer's ip address.
This error was finally tracked down but I was unable to fix it despite going to the node.js
bonus session and spending 20 minutes troubleshooting.
