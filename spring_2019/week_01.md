## Last Week's Accomplishments

We established expectations on what work was required in what time fram to make sure the project does not stagnate.

## This Week's Plan

The goal of this week is to successfully add a class to my schdule using post request on postman.
This will allow the project to advance in scrapping relevant information needed for it's processes. 

## Anything Blocking?

Another team member has been locked out of their sis due to erroneous log in attempts.
