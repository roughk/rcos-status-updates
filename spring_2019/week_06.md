## Last Week's Accomplishments

Last week was more or less a blunder for the project.
Mainly just functionality discussions.

## This Week's Plan

Add QOL files to the shchedj such as a code of conduct will be added.
Get the simulation app to work again on my phone so I can continue coding confidently.

## Anything Blocking?

A meeting was not had with new members as a time could not be agreed upon.
This was seriously detrimental to potentially getting them up to speed and working.
Further effort must be made this week to ensure smooth integration.
npm expo on my phone or computer wont work, need to diagnose issue.
