## Last Week's Accomplishments
- Finished up work on our slides and prepared to present it at the large group. 
- Finished ironing out features intended to be presented during the demo
- Discussed summer work plans and future RCOS 

## Notes
My number of commits doesn't solely represent the amount of work I did this semester.
For schedj I acted more as a sort of manager than as a core programmer. During our
meetings, I would discuss UI design with the project leader who would then implement
the features into the program. As well, I wrote some independent test/training code
with javascript that isn't reflected on the repository. Overall I believe schedj made
good progress this semester and I expect it to be functional next semester, as the
team wishes to continue work over the summer.

Have a good summer whoever is read this <3
